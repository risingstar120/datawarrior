# Compile PluginInfo,PluginStarter and all referenced plugin task classes and interfaces

# If your plugin uses classes that are part of DataWarrior itself or OpenChemLib (which is part of DataWarrior),
# then you should not include these classes into your final plugin.jar, because
# under runtime conditions the plugin has full access to all classes included in datawarrior.jar.
# When building the plugin, however, you need to include datawarrior.jar in the classpath, e.g.:
# javac -Xlint:unchecked -sourcepath ./src -classpath datawarrior.jar:. org/openmolecules/datawarrior/plugin/*.java

# Remove all interfaces that are part of DataWarrior anyway
rm bin/org/openmolecules/datawarrior/plugin/I*.class

# Build plugin jar file and add a manifest to show message when jar is double clicked
jar -cfm examplePlugin.jar manifest_additions.txt -C ./bin .

rm -r ./bin
