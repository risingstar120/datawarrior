<p>Biological properties of a chemical substance depend largely on its 3-dimensional structure, i.e.
on the interaction potential of its atoms, their geometrical orientation and on the flexibility of
the molecule. Typically, a molecule has not one but many low energy conformers and to understand
the biological potential of a compound one needs to investigate its conformer structures in detail.
The <span class="keyword">Flexophore</span> descriptor was designed to cover all representative
conformers of a molecule and to even consider its flexibility. Calculating similarities between
molecules using the <span class="keyword">Flexophore</span> is easy and allows to detect molecules
whose conformers have a high potential to interact with a target protein in a similar way.
Nevertheless, it doesn't reveal any insights into the 3-dimensional nature of a compounds.</p>
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> has a conformer generator and forcefield based energy
minimization built in, which together allow generating diverse and low energy conformers, which
can be explored within <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>, can be exported to be used in
other software packages, or can be even rendered to yield photo-realistic images. Within
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> there are three views, that may show conformers: First, the
detail area automatically includes a 3D-molecule viewer, if a structure column has associated
conformer information. Second, the form view may contain a form item that shows conformers and, third,
the <a href="help/conformers.html#Explore">conformer explorer</a>, of course, shows conformers.

</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Generate"></a>Generating Conformers</h3>
<p>
This functionality creates one or multiple conformers for every structure within a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
document. Various algorithms for the conformer generation and subsequent energy minimization are available.
To create conformers for the current data window's molecules, select <span class="menu">Generate Conformers...</span>
from the <span class="menu">Chemistry</span> menu. A dialog allows to define options for the conformer generator.</p>

<p>If you work with <span class="keyword">LigandScout</span> from Inteligand, then you should know that from Version 4.4.2
on <span class="keyword">LigandScout</span> is able to directly read conformers from native DataWarrior files,
no matter whether a row contains just one or multiple conformers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/generate.jpeg" width="405" height="415"></p>
<p><center><i>Conformer Generator Options</i></center></p>

<p><b>Structure column:</b> A column containing chemical structures for which to generate the conformers.</p>
<p><b>Algorithm:</b> Most of the algorithms, which can be selected here, share the same general procedure
to generate conformers, a rule based assembly of self organized rigid fragments:<br>
First <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> locates all freely rotatable bonds
of the molecule, which are not part of a ring. By cutting any of these bonds a set of more or less rigid
fragments is obtained. For any of these fragments a self organization based algorithm creates one or multiple
fragment conformers.<br>
In a second step the local environment of every rotatable bond is used to assign the bond to a specific bond class.
Using bond classes <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> assigns preferred torsion angles to any rotatable bond.
These are taken from experimental, i.e. crystallographic data. Torsion angle likelyhoods are used in addition, which
reflect how often a particular torsion angle is found in x-ray data.<br>
In a third step, the fragments are then assembled using the preferred torsions for every rotatable bond.
A collision check determines, whether the combination of torsions causes any atom collisions.
If no collision occurs, the conformer is accepted and a new permutation is chosen. Otherwise,
the algorithm creates a rule about a torsion combination, which leads to a collision. These rules are considered
when constructing new conformers.<br>
Potentially, the number of constructable conformers may be very high, depending on the number of rotatable bonds,
the number of torsions per bond and the number of self-organized fragment conformers. Therefore, a selectable
algorithm prioritizes how torsion angles are permutated, how atom collisions are handled and to which extend
likely torsions are preferred:
<ul>
<li><span class="keyword">Random, low energy bias:</span> This strategy randomly selects for every new conformer
a new set of torsions and fragments. However, a weighted random method is used giving more likely torsion angles
and better scoring fragments a higher chance of being selected that the less likely ones. This is a well ballanced
strategy leading to diverse low energy conformers.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Pure random:</span> The degrees of freedom are selected randomly neglecting any
likelyhoods. This produces the most diverse conformers, but not necessarily low energy ones.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Adaptive collision avoidance, low energy bias:</span> This strategy starts and works
like the <span class="keyword">low energy biased random</span> strategy until a set of torsion angles causes
atom collisions. Then, for every rotatable bond is determined to which extend its current rotation state
contributes to atom collisions. With a weighted random approach one of the rotatable bonds is chosen to be modified
next, such that the likelyhood for the next conformer is high to escape the collision.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Systematic, low energy bias:</span> The starting point for this algorithm is that
conformer, which uses for any degree of freedom the most likely option, i.e. the torsion angle for every
rotatable bond and the best scoring fragment conformer where we have multiple choices. For the next conformer
only that degree of freedom is changed, which goes along with the smallest the drop in overall likelyhood.
This way, the most likely conformers are produced first, but the initial diversity may not be very high.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Self organized:</span> This algorithm does not use the general procedure described above.
It applies a self organization approach to the entire molecule. For that all atoms are initialized with random
coordinates. The a list of constraints is determined as follows: Distance constrainst define preferred distances
between any two atoms. Plane constraints group atoms, which should share the same plane. Other constraints
handle preferred torsions, stereochemistry and atoms on a straight line. In a kind of minimization procedure
constraints are randomly picked and their atoms relocated in space to better meet the constraint. This algorithm
works best with highly constrained, i.e. rigid structures like bridged ring systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Initial torsion:</b> Since using crystallographic data derived torsion angles introduces a certain bias
and in order to mimic other conformer generator's construction principles, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior's</span>
conformer generator may also forgo using experimental torsion data. Instead it may use six torsion angles per rotatable
bond with 60 degree steps. In this case all six torsion angles are considered equally likely. Of course, conformers constructed this
way are often far off the local energy minimum and probably should be energy minimized afterwards.</p>

<p><b>Minimize energy:</b> Rule based assembled or self-organized conformers like those created by the above algorithms
may still suffer from angle strains, slight atom collisions or suboptimal torsions, because the local environment
of a particular molecule may not be well represented by more general rules that were used for the construction.
To reduce strain and minimize energies these conformers can be further optimized by applying one of these forcefields:
<li><span class="keyword">MMFF94s+ forcefield:</span> This is an optimized version of the MMFF94s force field,
which adresses known and unrealistic torsion parameterization of the original MMFF94s implementation.
The torsion angle analysis and corrections were done by Joel Wahl. A peer-reviewed publication is in process.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">MMFF94s forcefield:</span> The Merck Molecular Force Field 94 is a widely used
and well known forcefield based on the MM3 forcefield. It is parameterized to be applicable to a wide range
of organic compounds. The implementation that <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses was ported
from the RD-Kit to Java and validated by Daniel Bergmann and Paolo Tosco, who earlier had developed the
MMFF94 implementation in C++ for the RD-Kit as well.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Idorsia forcefield:</span> This forcefield is based on the MM2 forcefield. Its
implementation in Java was developed by Joel Freyss. It is also universally applicable and mainly used for
in-house purposes at Idorsia.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Don't minimize:</span> This option passes through all conformers as they are generated
by the construction algorithm.</li>
</p>
<p><b>Max. conformer count:</b> The number of generated conformers per compound will be limited to this number.
If more than one conformer is generated and if these are not written into an external file, then these are
automatically pooled into one row and aligned on the most central rigid fragment of the molecule.</p>
<p><b>Write into file:</b> When this option is selected, generated conformers are exported into a compound file
rather than added to the current dataset.</p>
<p><b>File type:</b> The most widely supported format is probably the SD-file version 2, while the most compact file
format is certainly a native DataWarrior file.</p>
<p><b>Pool conformers of same compound:</b> If conformers are saved as a native DataWarrior file, then this option
allows storing all conformers of one compound into the same target row. Within DataWarrior such a
conformer set will then be displayed in the detail view as a conformer ensemble that is automatically superposed
using the most central rigid fragment.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/conformerSet.jpeg" width="230" height="202"></p>
<p><center><i>Conformer ensemble shown in DataWarrior's detail area</i></center></p>
<p>When conformer ensembles are exported from DataWarrior into SD-files, then every conformer is saved as an individual molecule record.
However, within a native DataWarrior file the connection table is only stored once, while atom coordinates of every conformer
are included as a compact text string. Therefore, storing conformer ensembles as native DataWarrior files is very space-efficient
and flexible at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Remove small fragments:</b> If this option is selected, then all unconnected fragments except for the largest
one are removed from the molecule before conformers are generated. This is particularly advisable, if a forcefield
minimization is used, which may potentially take a very long time to optimize relative positions of non connected
fragments.</p>
<p><b>Neutralize remaining fragment:</b> If this option and the <i>Remove small fragment</i>i> option both are selected,
then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> tries after the removal of all small fragments to neutralize all
charged atoms of the remaining fragment through protonation or deprotonation. If quarternary nitrogens cannot
be deprotonated, the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> tries to deprotonate acidic atoms to achieve a
neutral overall charge.</p>
<p><b>Skip compounds with more than NN stereo isomers:</b> If a molecule contains undefined stereo centers,
then the conformer generator randomly constructs stereo isomers. Depending on the purpose, molecules with a high
potential number of isomers and therefore an even higher number of representing conformers may pose a problem, e.g.
for virtual screening where they cause high computation time and a low probability that found hits really represent
the correct stereo isomer. This option allows to just skip this kind of molecules.</p>
<p><b>Create proper protonation state:</b> This option is available for selection only, if the ChemAxon pKa-Plugin
is installed and DataWarrior was configured to find it. If this option is selected, then the pKa-values of
basic and acidic atoms are determined using the ChemAxon method and these atoms are properly protonated
or deprotonated to reflect their natural state at the given pH value. If the value in the <b>+-</b> text field
is different from '0', then this defines a pH-range. In this case <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> may
produce more than one protonation state if the pKa of one or more of the basic or acidic atoms fall into the
pKa range.
</p>

<h3><a name="DetailArea"></a>3D-Structures in Detail Area</h3>
<p>When a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> file contains 3D-coordinates for chemical structures,
then the <span class="keyword">Detail Area</span> contains a dedicated 3D-structure viewer. Once the mouse
moves over a row in any main view, this detail view is updated to display the row's 3D-structure.
3D-structures can be rotated with the right mouse button, moved in x,y and z dimensions with the middle mouse
button and the scroll wheel, respectively. A right mouse click opens a popup menu with options to show molecular
surfaces, change dispay or color modes, or measure angles, torsions and distances among atoms and bonds.</p>

<p>One useful application for the 3D-viewer would be the visual inspection of docking results, i.e.
comparing the position of the natural ligand with the locations of docked small molecules. For this
purpose the natural ligand needs to be superposed with any docked molecule in the same coordinate system.
This can be achieved in <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> if a file contains the natural ligand and the
docked molecules, by selecting the menu item <span class="menu">Superpose Reference Row</span>. In addition
one needs to make the natural ligand the reference row by clicking it in any view such that it gets a red frame.
Now, when moving the mouse from row to row, the 3D-detail-view is updated to show the row's docked molecule
structure together with the natural ligand.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/alignedconformers.png" width="506" height="263"></p>
<p><center><i>Detail area with aligned conformers and popup menu.</i></center></p>

<p>Another application may be to compare conformers in regard to their volume overlap when aligned properly.
For that purpose you need to select both options, <span class="menu">Superpose Reference Row</span> and
<span class="menu">Align Shapes</span>. The latter option causes <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
to optimally align both conformers using the <span class="keyword">PheSA</span> algorithm, which is a rigid
alignment method that optimizes shape overlap as well as pharmacophoric feature overlap.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Explore"></a>Exploring Conformers of a Molecule</h3>
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> has a built-in <span class="keyword">conformer explorer</span>
that allows to inspect multiple conformers of the same molecule. To open the <span class="keyword">conformer explorer</span>
select <span class="menu">Explore conformers of 'Structure'...</span> from the popup menu, which appears when clicking
the right mouse button on top of any structure or marker within any main view. Conformers may be shown with a small delay,
because one set of conformers is generated immediately. You may use the mouse wheel for zooming and moving conformers
within the screen plane. Conformers may be rotated using the right mouse button. A right mouse click on a conformer
opens a context sensitive popup menu with options for rendering, molecular surface display and distance and angle measurement.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/explorer1.jpeg" width="680" height="433"></p>
<p><center><i>Conformer Explorer with superposed conformers</i></center></p>
<p>
The bottom panel of the <span class="keyword">conformer explorer</span> shows some controls to regenerate
conformers with different settings, to separate individual conformers, to display molecular surfaces, to save
conformers into a file and to define, which atoms are super-positioned. To change these atoms, click the
<span class="menu">Superpose...</span> button, select the atoms, which shall be superposed, and close the dialog.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/explorer2.jpeg" width="680" height="433"></p>
<p><center><i>Conformer Explorer with separated conformers and molecular surfaces</i></center></p>
<p>
To freshly generate new conformers within the <span class="keyword">conformer explorer</span> you may select
the maximum number of conformers, the algorithm to be used, and a forcefield for the energy minimization. Then press
the <span class="menu">Generate</span> button. The available algorithms are explained in previous section.
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Render"></a>Photorealistic Rendering</h3>
<p>
If you select the <span class="menu">Photo-Realistic Image...</span> item from the popup menu of any of
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior's</span> 3D molecule viewers, then a dialog opens that lets you calculate
a photo-realistic image using the professional quality ray-tracer <span class="keyword">Sunflow</span>,
which is part of the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installation. The dialog lets you choose various options.
<ul>
<li><span class="keyword">Image size:</span> This is the size of the created image in pixel.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Environment:</span> This option contains some predefined lighting, color and material
conditions as <i>bright sun</i> and <i>black background</i>.</li>
<li><span class="keyword">Move and zoom to fill image:</span> If this option is selected, the molecule is rotated
automatically to expose its largest possible silhouette to the camera. Furthermore, it is zoomed and moved
to just about fill the image. If this option is not selected, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> tries
to mimic the perspective and zoom state of the conformer panel. Since the rendering concepts of the ray-tracer and
the conformer viewer are different, the original perspective will be similar, but not necessarily exactly reproduced.</li>
</ul>
As soon as the render dialog is closed, a new window opens, in which all available processor cores are busy to
render the molecule. Once the image is completed one may save it to a file or copy it to the clipboard by selecting
the appropriate option from a popup menu. The following picture shows an example taken from the
<span class="keyword">Crystallography Open Database</span>.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/raytrace.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Photorealistic image of COD entry 2230709,<br>

<h3><a name="Superpose"></a>Superposing Conformers</h3>

<p>If the binding conformer of a protein's ligand is known or at least suspected, then this
is often used to search compound collections for similar conformers regarding shape and
pharmacophore features. In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> you can perform such
a virtual screening in two steps: First you <a href="help/conformers.html#Generate">create
multiple conformers</a> from the molecules to be screened.
Then you try superposing these conformers with the binding conformer of a known ligand.
For this purpose <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses an algorithm called
<a href="help/phesa.html">PheSA (Pharmacophore enhanced shape alignment)</a>, which uses
Gaussian functions to calculate and optimize the shared volume of two molecules' conformers
while considering pharmacophore feature overlay at the same time.</p>

<p>If your dataset contains 3D-atom coordinates, then you may open the dialog to configure
the superpositioning with <span class="menu">Superpose Conformers...</span> from the
<span class="menu">Chemistry</span> menu. A simple dialog opens, where you may select the
column that contains the conformers. Typically there is only one structure column with one
3D-atom coordinates column, thus, nothing to select from. In addition to the conformer column
you need to specify the 3D-molecule, which shall be PheSA-matched against all conformers.
This is done with a right mouse click in the blue initially empty area. A popup menu lets
you import a molecule from either a molfile, the ligand from a PDB-file or from the PDB-database.
Alternatively, you can also paste in a structure. If the clipboard contains a molecule with
2D-atom coordinates, then a low-energy conformer is created on the fly.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/superposeDialog.jpeg" width="465" height="318"></p>
<p><center><i>Dialog configured to superpose all energy-minimized 3D-Structures of a data set
with a given conformer of the CNS-drug Alpidem.</i></center></p>

<p>After clicking <span class="menu">OK</span>, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> tries
matching the shape of all conformers of any row with the given target molecule(s).
As result you will receive an additional column 'PheSA Score'. Values being close to 1.0 indicate
a very high shape and pharmacophore feature match. A second hidden column 'Best Match' contains
the best matching stereo isomer of the input structure. When the input structure doesn't contain
multiple stereo isomers, then the best matching structure and input structure are always identical.
Hence, this column usually is of limited use and, therefore, is hidden as default. You may make it
visible with a right mouse click on the table header and choosing <span class="menu">Show 'Best Match'</span>.</p>
<p>Infact, there is another invisible column containing 3D-atom-coordinates of the best matching
stereo isomer, such that the overlay with the query structure is optimized. The detail area shows
the best matching conformer together with the superposed query structure.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/conf/superposeResult.png" width="490" height="223"></p>
<p><center><i>New columns after superposing; detail area shows two optimally superposed structures.</i></center></p>

<p>If you had defined multiple query structures in the dialog, then you would have received one new
'PheSA Score' column for each query structure. You would also have got distinct new columns for the
best matching isomers and 3D-superpositions.</p>
