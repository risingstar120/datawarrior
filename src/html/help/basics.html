<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> is an interactive, chemistry-aware
multi-purpose data visualization and analysis program. It works on any kind of tabular data
assuming rows to contain objects or cases and columns to contain associated properties and values.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> provides interactive views to visualize data,
to discover correlations and to extract hidden knowledge from large data sets.
Data filters allow focusing on specific data subsets in a dynamic way.
Chemical intelligence is woven into the program to work with chemical structures
as easily as with numerical values. Data can be filtered on structural motives,
views are chemistry aware, molecule properties can be predicted from chemical structures, and
specialized cheminformatics methods explore the relationship between chemical structure
and measured properties.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> supports multiple files types and allows
merging data from files with data from the clipboard or from databases.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> is freely available for Linux, Macintosh and Windows
and its complete source code is downloadable under the
<span class="keyword">GNU Public License</span>.<br>
This section explains general concepts and explains important keywords.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="MainAndDetailViews"></a>Main View Area and Detail Area</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">Main View Area</span> shows one or multiple
<span class="keyword">Main Views</span>, everyone displaying data rows either as data table,
in a 2- or 3-dimensional interactive chart, or in another type of view.
Typically, multiple <span class="keyword">Main Views</span> show the same (sub-)set of data,
but display the data different ways. Multiple <span class="keyword">Main Views</span>
can coexist either stacked on top of each other or side by side.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/basics/viewAreas.jpeg" width="680" height="510"></p>
<p><center><i>Typical DataWarrior window with relevant areas shown in distinct colors.</i></center></p>

<p>The <b>+</b> button on any <span class="keyword">Main View's</span> title area allows
to create a new <span class="keyword">Main View</span> or to create a high resultion picture
of the view. Other buttons let you configure, maximize, or close the view.
<span class="keyword">Main Views</span> can be moved to another position
by dragging their header area onto the center or any edge of another view.</p>
<p>While <span class="keyword">Main Views</span> show many rows at a time,
the <span class="keyword">Detail Area</span> aims to display all information of one particular row.
When moving the mouse within a <span class="keyword">Main View</span>,
then the <span class="keyword">Detail Area</span> is constantly updated to reveal the details
of the row or marker underneath the mouse pointer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Table View</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">Table View</span> serves as a direct window to
the data contained in a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> file. Through it
rows can be sorted, data can be modified, and display options
for individual columns can be changed. The <span class="keyword">Table View</span>
cannot be removed nor can there be a second <span class="keyword">Table View</span>.
Columns may contain and display non-alpha-numerical content like molecules or reactions.
The visible column order may be changed. Columns can be added, grouped, hidden, or removed.
A column specific popup menu is accessible with a right mouse click on the respective column header.

<br>
<h3>2D-View</h3>
<p>This view visualizes table data in a 2-dimensional chart, e.g. as a scatter plot,
bar or pie chart, or box plot. The view type and other view related properties can be
chosen from the popup menu that opens when the title area's <b>wrench</b> button is clicked.
Colors, marker shapes and sizes, connection lines, labels, font sizes, are customizable.
The <b>xy</b> button lets you assign columns to axes and axis-wise zoom into the data.</p>
<p>The view is dynamically linked with the <span class="keyword">Detail Area</span>.
When the mouse is moved over a marker or bar/pie fraction, then the corresponding row
data is displayed in the <span class="keyword">Detail Area</span>. A right mouse click
now opens a popup menu giving access to functionality related to this particular row.

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/basics/2dviews.jpeg" width="620" height="292"></p>
<br>
<h3>3D-View</h3>
<p> The <b>3D-View</b> is similar to the 2D-View, however, it displays markers or bars
in a freely rotatable three dimensional cartesian coordinate system. The left mouse button can be
used to select row markers or to change the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>.
Pressing and dragging the right mouse button rotates the view. Again the <b>wrench</b> and <b>xyz</b>
give access to view related properties and axis assignments.

<br>
<h3>Form View</h3>
<p>
<span class="keyword">Form Views</span> present your data like a book with one page per data row.
A <span class="keyword">Design Mode</span> allows to custom tailor the form layout, i.e. to define,
which column data is displyed where on the form.
An <span class="keyword">Edit Mode</span> allows to directly modify the displayed data.
<span class="keyword">Form Views</span> are particularly useful, if rows contain conformers or
some of their cells reference html or picture detail information. Neither conformers nor referenced
detail information is displayed in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>.
Only the <span class="keyword">detail area</span> or form views show this information.

<h3><a name="Filters"></a>Filters</h3>
<p>
Filters are used to hide rows from all main views to temporarily focus on subset of the data.
Various filter kinds are available, but they all share certain characteristics.
Usually, all filters apply to all views, which means that if a row is hidden by one or more
filters, then it is not visible in any view. Views, however, can be configured to ignore filters.
Usually, a filter is associated with one data column. The kind of data determines,
which filter types can be used for a column.
The effect of a filter can be inverted by selecting its <span class="menu">Invert</span> button.
A <span class="menu">Disable</span> button allows to temporarily switch off the filtering effect
without removing the filter's settings. Some filters possess animation options that can be set
to automatically change the visible data subset over time in a stepwise or smooth fashion.
The <span class="keyword">Status Area</span> at the bottom of any <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
window always displays the number of visible rows, selected rows, and all rows.</p>
<p>These filter types exist:</p>
<table class="wspace">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/sliders.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace"><span class="keyword">Sliders</span> filter rows based on numerical 
      or date values. They define an allowed or forbidden data range by defining 
      minimum and maximum values. Pressing <span class="menu">Ctrl</span> while dragging
      allows fine-tuning. After clicking a numerical value it can be edited with the keyboard.
      Red bars indicate that the corresponding column contains empty values, which
      the slider's numerical range cannot include.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/textFilter.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace"><span class="keyword">Text filters</span> may be used to hide rows, which match
      or don't match a query in a certain way. This includes a sub-string search, an exact match, or a
      <a class="links" href="help/regex.html">regular expression</a> search. If multiple comma separated
      text snippets are given, then all rows are hidden, which match none of the individual query strings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/categories.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace"><span class="keyword">Category filters</span> hide certain categories of the data. Rows are 
      hidden if they don't belong to any of the checked categories. If some rows 
      belong to multiple categories at the same time, then a &lt;multiple categories&gt; 
      option is offered. If this is checked then rows belonging into multiple 
      categories are kept from hiding.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/categoryBrowser.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">A <span class="keyword">Category Browser</span> allows to quickly browse
      through the different categories within a dataset. This can be done stepwise
      through clicking the 'previous' and 'next' buttons or more rapidly by dragging the slider.
      Using the <span class="menu">Animate</span> button <span class="keyword">Category Browsers</span>
      can be configured to automatically cycle through all categories one by one.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/listFilter.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace"><span class="keyword">Row list filters</span> are used to hide all
      members of a
      selected hitlist or all rows that do not belong to that hitlist.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/structureFilter.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">Chemical <span class="keyword">structure filters</span> may be used to 
      show or hide compounds with a given substructure or that are similar to a 
      given molecule. <a href="help/chemistry.html#StructureFilter">More...</a><br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/sssList.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">Two specialized filters allow an immediate filtering based on multiple
      structures at once. The <span class="keyword">SSS list filter</span> run a parallel
      sub-structure-search on multiple query structures and hides rows, whose molecules
      don't contain any of the listed query fragments. Fragment lists can be
      loaded from file, edited manually or combined by drag and drop.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/simList.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">A <span class="keyword">Similarity structure list filter</span> may be used to 
      hide rows, whose molecules are not similar to any of the listed structures.
      Any currently available descriptor may serve as similarity criterion.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/reactionFilter.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">Similar to the structure filter, the reaction filter offers
        similarity and sub-structure based reaction filtering. Once a query reaction
        is drawn, rows may independently be filtered on similarities of the reaction center
        and on the periphery. Both modes, reaction substructure and reaction similarity filtering
        require reactions to be mapped, which means that all reactant atoms, which also exist on the
        product side, must be mapped to the respective product atoms.

    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/retronFilter.png"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">A <span class="keyword">retron</span> is a structural pattern, i.e. a
        substructure on the product side, that is created within the reaction. This filter offers an
        easy way to quickly search a reaction collection. It does not need any atom mapping,
        neither in the query nor in searched reaction collection.

      </td>

    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/implicitViewFilter.jpeg"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">Per default any visible graphical view also serves as implicit filter.
      When the <span class="menu">xyz</span> button is clicked, then a popup appears
      that allows assigning data columns to view axes and zooming into particular
      axes. When individual row markers are zoomed out of the view, they disappear
      also from other views. This visibility influence on other views can be changed
      in the view's <span class="keyword">General View Options</span>. When a graphical
      view gets hidden behind other views, then its filtering effect is disabled until
      the view gets visible again.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="wspace"><p><img src="help/img/basics/explicitViewFilter.jpeg"></p></td>
      <td class="wspace">One of all graphical views may be chosen to serve as an
      explicit filter. This view then behaves differently, when rows are lasso-surrounded with the mouse.
      Instead of globally selecting rows, the local view shows these rows in <b><font color="#660066">purple</font></b>
      color. This causes all <b>non-<font color="#660066">purple</font></b> rows to disappear from all other views.
      This offers a quick way to flexibly show selectable data subsets in all other views.
      </td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Depending on the data, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> shows a reasonable set of
default filters. One can always add more filters with <span class="menu">Edit->New Filter...</span>
or remove filters by clicking the close button. Filters can be re-arranged by grabbing its name and
dragging it to a new position.</p>
<p>Multiple active filters accumulate their affects, which means that rows are hidden if they don't
match the filter condition of at least one filter.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="VisibleRows"></a>Visible Rows</h3>
<p> The <span class="keyword">Visible Rows</span> are those rows, which are
currently visible in the main view area. Typically the set of <span class="keyword">
Visible Rows</span> is a subset of all rows of the dataset. Its number is always
displayed in the status area. The visibility of rows is primarily affected by filter
settings. However, a visible main view may also hide some rows,
e.g. through zooming or if the data row has empty values. This usually hides effected rows from other
visible views as well, unless the hiding view is configured to not contribute to global
row hiding. Main views, which are hidden behind other views, don't contribute to global row hiding.
Thus, the number of <span class="keyword">Visible Rows</span> may change when main views change visibility.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="SelectedRows"></a>Selected Rows</h3>
<p>All main views except for the <span class="keyword">Form View</span> allow to select
or deselect rows with the mouse. The row selection is shared among all views. Thus,
when you change the row selection in one view, the selection in all other views is
updated simultaniously. The number of (visible) selected rows is always displayed in the status area.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="ReferenceRow"></a>Reference Row</h3>
<p>With a mouse click one row can be defined as the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>.
As with the <span class="keyword">Selected Rows</span>, the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>
is shared among all views. Most views mark the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> with a
<b> <font color="#FF0000">red frame</font></b> or show it in <b><font color="#FF0000">red color</font></b>. 
The <span class="keyword">Form View</span> always shows the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>.
Various view features use the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> to compare all other rows to,
e.g. when using color to show similarities, when compound similarity is assigned to an axis,
or when constructing neighbourship graphs, etc. Views may be configured to automatically zoom and move
the view such that the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span> is displayed in the view's center.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="RowLists"></a>Row Lists</h3>
<p>A <span class="keyword">Row List</span> is a named subset of all rows.
In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> <span class="keyword">Row Lists</span> may be used for
various purposes, e.g. to filter rows, to affect marker sizes, shapes or colors, to highlight a group of rows,
to store a current row selection, to define a data subset for a data analysis method, etc.
<span class="keyword">Row Lists</span> are automatically saved within DataWarrior files.
The <span class="menu">List</span> menu contains the functionality to create and
manipulate <span class="keyword">Row Lists</span>. <a href="help/lists.html">More...</a></p>

<br>
<h3><a name="Templates"></a>Templates</h3>
<p>A <span class="keyword">Template</span> comprises all <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
display settings. It includes the information about existing views and their orientation,
all view specific settings like marker colors, font sizes, shown labels etc. It contains information about active
filters and their settings, column aliases and about the layout of existing form views.
<span class="keyword">Templates</span> are part of a native <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
file and may also be stored as a stand-alone file to be later re-applied to another similar or updated data set.
Templates may also be associated with a database query, such that query results are immediately shown
in a predefined way.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Macros"></a>Tasks and Macros</h3>
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> is primarily a program to interactively work with data. Every
single interactively performed action is called a <span class="keyword">task</span>. <span class="keyword">Tasks</span>
may be simple ones like opening a file and changing a filter setting or they may be more complicated and require
defining various parameters e.g. to launch a 2-dimensional scaling algorithm. By sequentially performing multiple
<span class="keyword">tasks</span> in a row one may solve rather complex data analysis problems.</p>
<p>To support automation and reproducibility <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> allows recording
interactive <span class="keyword">task</span> sequences as <span class="keyword">macros</span>, which can be
saved to file, edited, and executed at a later time on different or updated data or by a different person.
