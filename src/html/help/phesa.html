<h2><a name="PheSA"></a>Pharmacophore Enhanced Shape Alignment "PheSA"</h2>
<hr align="left" size="2" width="550">
<p>For a ligand molecule to inhibit a receptor or enzyme with high efficacy
it must fit well into the protein's active site, which means that it must have a
low energy conformer, whose shape fits nicely into the pocket and whose atoms are
optimally positioned to establish attractive polar and apolar interactions with
the protein atoms. If the binding conformer of an efficacious ligand structure
is known, then a typical virtual screening strategy is to assess the shape and
pharmacophoric feature similarity of multiple conformers of the candidate molecules.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Typical task: Binding conformer of CSF1R inhibitor & query structure</i></p>

<p>The PheSA algorithm was designed for this purpose. It first aligns two rigid 3D-molecules
such that both, their shape and their pharmacophore feature overlap is maximized.
In this regard PheSA is similar to OpenEye's ROCS technology. The optimized
alignment of both molecules is then quantitatively described by the <i>PheSA similarity</i>,
a value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 that is composed of equal contributions of both, shape
and pharmacophore similarity.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Best matching query conformer aligned to known binding CSF1R inhibitor</i></p>

<p>Typical applications of PheSA are the alignment of chemical structures for visual
inspection or binding-mode hypotheses, as well as for virtual screening to identify
molecules that have 3D-similarity to a known query.</p>

<p>If you know or believe to know the binding conformer of a small molecule that is active
as inhibitor or antagonist against a protein target, then you may use the <span class="keyword">PheSA</span>
algorithm from within <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> for these purposes:<il>
<li>To virtually screen a compound collection for potential target activity judging by the
<a class=content href="help/conformers.html#Superpose">superpositioning</a> score</li>
<li>To visualize best conformer shape and pharmacophore similarities after
<a class=content href="help/conformers.html#Superpose">superpositioning</a></li>
<li>As fitness criterion when <a class=content href="help/chemistry.html#EvolutionaryLibraries">
