<h2><a name="ChemicalStructures"></a>Working With Chemical Structures And Reactions</h2>

<hr align="left" size="2" width="550">
<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> was designed from the outset as a chemistry aware
data analysis and visualization platform. Its built-in chemistry intelligence allows working
with chemical structures as easily as with alphanumerical data. Rows may be filtered based on
whether molecules contain certain sub-structures or on various kinds of molecule similarities.
Views may display molecular structures as labels or on the axes. Various kinds of molecule
similarities can be translated into marker positions, sizes or colors.
Data analysis methods like the principal component analysis or self organizing maps can be
applied to chemical structures equally well as to alphanumerical data.</p>
<p>Dedicated cheminformatics functionality provide for state-of-the-art analysis methods from the
mere similarity comparison of two molecule lists to more advanced methods as an activity cliff
analysis, SAR-table creation or the enumeration of virtual combinatorial substance libraries.
2-dimensional scaling methods help to visualize compound collections and the prediction of
compound properties to support the characterization and selection of compounds.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Basics"></a>Chemical Structure Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Internally <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> represents chemical structures as
so-called <span class="keyword">ID-Codes</span>, which are very compact text strings that
encode chemical structures in a canonical form. This means that no matter, in which order the
atoms and bonds have been drawn, if two structures represent the same molecule,
then their ID-Codes are also identical. ID-Codes contain aromaticity information and all stereo features.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> fully supports the concept of
<a href="https://www.3dsbiovia.com/products/pdf/enhanced-stereochemical-representation.pdf">
Enhanced Stereochemical Representation (ESR)</a>, which not only considers basic stereo features
(configurations stereo centers and double bonds), but also the relationsships between them.
This allows to define mixtures of enantiomers, diastereomers, or epimers, when drawing the structure.
The ESR information is encoded in a canonical form into the ID-Codes and <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
is using it, whenever appropriate, e.g. when displaying or editing chemical structures,
during substructure search, or when generating conformers.</p>

<p>ID-Codes that represent substructures as opposed to molecules may also contain atom
and bond related query features. Reactions can be represented by ID-Codes as well.</p>
<p>ID-Codes don't include atom coordinates. Therefore, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
typically stores atom coordinates in a separate, invisible column.</p>

<p>Much, of what you can do with molecular structures in <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>,
especially if it is related to structure similarity, requires the presence of
<span class="keyword">descriptors</span> derived from the chemical structure.
The kind of descriptors, which can be generated and used by <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>,
are explained in more detail in a section called <a href="help/similarity.html">Similarity & Descriptors</a>.
Like the atom coordinates, descriptors are also stored in invisible columns. To calculate a new
descriptor column for a given chemical structure column you need to select its name from the
<span class="menu">Chemistry->From Chemical Structure->Calculate Descriptor</span> menu.</p>

<p>The <span class="menu">Chemistry->From Chemical Structure</span> menu contains various
additional items, which allow adding a new column with data derived from the chemical structure:</p>

<p><a name="AddFormula"></a><b>Add Molecular Formula...:</b> Adds a new column containing the molecular formular of the
chosen structure column.</p>

<p><a name="AddSmiles"></a><b>Add SMILES Code...:</b> SMILES codes (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) are a
widely used text encoding of chemical structures that can be interpreted by humans.
SMILES were originally developed by David Weininger and used by Daylight Information Systems.
Basic SMILES were neither encoding stereo features, nor were they canonical. Extended
versions (isomeric, absolute, and unique SMILES) solved this issue. However, it should be noted that
SMILES codes cover only basic stereo features. An enhanced stereo representation (ESR) concept is not part of it.
Canonical SMILES from different vendor's software packages are not necessarily identical, even if
they encode the same molecule. There is no standard that would define the rules for producing canonical
SMILES, but the <a href="http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html">OpenSMILES Specification</a>
defines the syntax for isomeric SMILES, which contain the molecular graph including aromaticity and
basic stereo features. <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> generates <span class="keyword">absolute SMILES</span>,
i.e. canonical SMILES with stereo features. Thus, keep in mind that you loose all ESR information, when
generating and using SMILES for other purposes.</p>

<p><a name="AddInchi"></a><b>Add Standard Inchi...:</b> InChI is an International Chemical Identifier developed under
the auspices of IUPAC, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry [1], with principal contributions from NIST
(the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology [2]) and
the <a href="https://www.inchi-trust.org/">InChI Trust</a>. <span class="keyword">DataWarrior's</span>
Inchi support is based on the JNI-Inchi project, which implemented Inchi version 1.03. Like SMILES code,
Inchi does not support <span class="keyword">Enhanced Stereochemical Representation (ESR)</span>.</p>

<p><a name="AddInchiKey"></a><b>Add Inchi Key...:</b> The Inchi key is a hash code of Standard Inchi, which means
that it is more compact, and a code uniquely derived from the structure, but it cannot be converted back into the
chemical structure.</p>

<p><a name="AddCanonicalCode"></a><b>Add Canonical Code...:</b> This method constructs a unique hash code from the
chemical structure. During this process it may neglect stereo information, normalize tautomeric states, and/or remove
small fragments. Because of this such hash codes may later be used to locate stereo isomers, tautomers, different salts
of the same structure, or/and combinations of this. Typically, one would afterwards remove redundant structures, or make lists
of duplicate or distinct structures and use these lists for further analysis.</p>
<p>After selecting this functionality a dialog opens letting you choose the structure column, and whether to distinguish
stereo isomers, whether to distinguish tautomers, and in case of multiple fragments whether to use the largest
fragment only. If, for example, you would neither select to distinguish tautomers nor stereo isomers, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> would take the structure, remove all stereo information,
construct a normalized tautomer, make a canonical representation from it and finally derive a hash code from that.
This way different stereo isomers and different tautomers would end up in the same structure and, therefore, produce
the same hash code.</p>

<p><a name="AddLargestFragment"></a><b>Add Largest Fragment...:</b> This removes counter ions from salts,
removes water molecules, and removes other potentially not important small molecules from the largest
and supposedly relevant molecule. The cleaned largest structure is then written into a new structure column.
If the option <b>Neutralize charges</b> is selected, then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> tries
to remove charges to neutralize the overall molecule. If <b>Convert to sub-structure</b> is selected, then the
generated fragments as well as the new column itself are marked to be/contain sub-structures instead of molecules.
Therefore, the fragments do not have implicit hydrogen atoms and a double click opens the structure editor in
sub-structure mode, which lets you define atom and bond query features. When selecting a few sub-structures
before starting a database query, you may choose in the query dialog to search the database agains any of the
selected sub-structures in one search.
</p>

<p><a name="AddSubstructureCount"></a><b>Add Substructure Count...:</b> This function determines for every molecule in a
table column, how many times a given substructure can be found inside the molecule's structure. In addition to the
substructure fragment itself, one may define whether the substructure search algorithm should only count separate
matches or whether matches shall be considered, which include atoms being part of an earlier counted match.
When counting benzene rings, then it would be found one or two times in naphtalene, depending on this setting.</p>

<h3><a name="StructureFilter"></a>The Structure Filter</h3>

<table class="wspace">
 <tr>
  <td class="wspace"><img src="help/img/chem/ssSearch.jpeg"></td>
  <td class="wspace">If a <i>DataWarrior</i> file contains chemical structures, then usually
the filter panel contains one or some <span class="keyword">Structure Filters</span>. In any
case one can always add new <span class="keyword">Structure Filters</span> by selecting
<span class="menu">New Filter...</span> from the <span class="menu">Edit</span> menu.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
A <span class="keyword">Structure Filter</span> option menu allows to switch between two
general operation modes:<br>

<li><span class="menu">contains</span> hides compounds (not) having a
certain a sub-structure</li>

<li><span class="menu">is similar to [...]</span> hides rows with
(dis-)similar structures. The descriptor used is given in brackets.</li>
<br>

<p>A double-click on the filter's structure field opens the <span class="keyword">Osiris
Structure Editor</span>. Please note that the behavior of the editor differs between the
sub-structure search and the similarity search. In the former case you edit a potentially
substituted chemical fragment that may contain query features while in
the latter case you define a complete molecule.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/editor.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Structure editor in molecule mode.</i></center></p>

<p>To edit a structure one typically selects a tool from the buttons on the left and
uses the mouse to apply the tool in the right structure area. The keyboard can be used
to accelerate the drawing process, e.g. typing a digit adds a chain of n atoms or changes
a bond order depending on whether the mouse pointer is on top of an atom or a bond.
'+' or '-' change an atom charge and <i>Del</i> removes selected atoms.
Typing one or more letters changes an atom type. More options to modify an existing
atom are available in the atom dialog, which opens after a double click on an atom.
A single click just applies the defined options to the clicked atom.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/atomDialog.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Atom dialog to define isotops, abnormal valences and custom atom labels.</i></center></p>

Most of the structure editor's buttons are rather self explanatory, while some
need a little more explanation. For a detailed description of the editor please
refer to the <a href="help/../editor/editor.html">Structure Editor</a> section.</p>
<br>

<h3>Substructure Search</h3>

<p>A filter in substructure search mode hides all rows, whose structures do not contain
the drawn molecule fragment. Required atom or bond features of the query fragment can be defined
to narrow the search. A double click on an atom or bond after selecting the lasso tool opens
an corresponding atom or bond query feature dialog. If multiple atoms or bonds have been selected,
then the dialog's settings are applied to all selected atoms or bonds when the dialog is closed.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/atomQF.jpeg"><br></p>
<p><center><i>Atom query feature dialog of structure editor in fragment mode.</i></center></p>

<p align="left">The first option in the atom query feature dialog lets you convert
a defined atom into a wild-card. In the following field <span class="menu">allowed atoms</span>
one may specify more precisely, which atom types are allowed at this position.
If <span class="menu">any atomic number</span> is selected and therefore the atom is
declared a wild-card then the <span class="menu">allowed atoms</span> field turns
into an <span class="menu">excluded atoms</span> field. This causes the struture search to accept
any atom but the explicitly excluded ones. While these options make the query fragment less specific,
all following options narrow the search. Most of these options are self explanatory.</p>

<p><a name="excludeGroups"></a>The option <span class="menu">is part of an exclude group</span> is a
powerful feature that goes well beyond a standard substructure search. This option lets you mark one
or more parts of a query structure to represent unwanted structural features. For instance, you may
use an exclude group to search for nitrogen atoms not having a carbonyl group attached, or for a
fluoro group that is not part of a di-or tri-fluoro substitution, for pyridine-groups without
methoxy in meta-position, or for ketones that don't have an aldehyde in the same molecule.
Exclude groups are also very useful in the context of generic reactions to build combinatorial
libraries.</p>
<p align="center"><img width=654 height=102 src="help/img/chem/excludeGroups.png"></p>
<p><center><i>Exclude groups are drawn in dark red with a pink background.</i></center></p>
<p>The image above shows four typical small sub-structure queries using exclude groups:<ul>
<li>an imidazole ring not being substituted by a carbonyl group at its 1-position</li>
<li>a nitrogen atom connected to at least one hydrogen, not bearing a carbonyl group, and not being connected to a non-carbon atom</li>
<li>a molecule containing exactly one nitrogen atom</li>
<li>a molecule not containing aromatic carbon atoms</li>
</ul>
If a query fragment contains any <span class="keyword">exclude groups</span>, then the substructure
search process runs in two steps. First it locates all matches of the query fragment not considering
exclude groups. For every match found in the first step, a second step tries to extend the original
match to include one after another of the exclude groups. If it succeeds with one of the exclude groups,
then the original match is skipped.</p>

<p>In the <span class="keyword">Structure Editor</span> atom or bond query features are
usually reflected in the drawing in an obvious way or indicated with small letters
(<i>s</i>:further substituted, <i>a</i>:aromatic, <i>h</i>:hydrogen count, <i>c</i>:charge,
<i>n</i>:neighbour count, <i>r</i>:ring size, etc.).
Some complex query features may not be shown directly. In any case atoms and bonds with query
features show a yellow spot in their background to indicate their special meaning.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/query.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Query fragment with yellow markers to indicate invisible query features.</i></center></p>

<p>In the bond query features dialog one may select more than one bond types, e.g.
<span class="keyword">Single</span> and <span class="keyword">Delocalized</span> as in the
example below. This would match the query bond to both, single and delocalized bonds.
It is important to understand that <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
considers 5-membered aromatic rings not to be delocalized. Therefore, the
<span class="keyword">Delocalized</span> option does not match to any bond of an aromatic
5-membered ring, unless it is annelated to an aromatic 6-membered ring, which is considered
delocalized and which causes the shared bond between the two rings to be delocalized as well.
In general <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> considers aromatic bonds with no
preferred mesomeric structure as being delocalized.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/bondQF.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Bond query feature dialog of structure editor in fragment mode.</i></center></p>

<p>An <span class="keyword">Atom Bridge</span> option allows to convert any bond of the query
structure to represent a chain of multiple connected atoms rather than a direct connection.
One defines the allowed number of atoms within the chain not counting the atoms already drawn
as part of the query structure.</p>

<p>If <span class="menu">Highlight Structure By -> Recent Filter</span> is selected in column
header menu of the structure column in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>, then
the query fragments as part of the entire molecule are drawn in dark red, while the rest
of the displayed structures is usually drawn in black.</p>
<br>

<h3>Structure Similarity Search</h3>
  
<p>To find structurally similar compounds rather than compounds sharing a specific
sub-structure, select any of the <span class="menu">is similar to [...]</span> options. Then
double-click the filter's structure area and draw a molecule using the
<span class="keyword">Structure Editor</span> or drag and drop a molecule from somewhere else to the filter.
You may adjust the similarity level to your needs. Typically, chemists will perceive molecules
as very similar if their similarity value is about 0.90 or above.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/simSearch.jpeg"></p>

<p>If <span class="menu">Highlight Structure By -> Recent Filter</span> is selected in column
header menu of the structure column in the <span class="keyword">Table View</span>, then structural
elements that are shared between displayed structures and the query structure are highlighted in green.</p>

<p>Per default Datawarrior calculates a <span class="keyword">FragFp descriptor</span>
of the first structure column within the data table. This descriptor can be used to
calculate similarities between molecules. The <span class="keyword">FragFp</span> similarity
between two molecules is the number of fragments that both molecules have in common
devided by the number of fragments being found in any of the two molecules.
If your dataset contains other descriptors, then your filter menu contains associated
<span class="menu">is similar to [...]</span> options that you may choose to filter
by another similarity criterion. Other descriptors can be calculated by choosing
<span class="menu">Chemistry->From Chemical Structure->Calculate Descriptor->...</span>
from the menu. Once the calculation has been finished, the associated similarity option
gets available in the filter menu.
Here you can find more information on <a href="help/similarity.html">descriptors and similarities</a>
and <a href="help/similarity.html#WhichDescriptor">which kind of similarity</a> should be used for which purpose.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ReactionFilter"></a>Reaction Sub-Structure Search</h3>

<p><p>If an open <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> window contains a column with chemical reactions,
then typically, the filter panel shows two filters offering reaction search, a reaction filter and a
retron filter. More filters can be added with <span class="menu">Edit->New Filter...</span>, e.g.
structure filters to search the reactants or products. Like the <span class="keyword">structure filter</span>
a <span class="keyword">reaction filter</span> (see below) has an option menu to choose between two modes,
<span class="menu">contains</span> and <span class="menu">is similar to [RxnFp]</span>.
If the <span class="menu">contains</span> mode is active, then one may draw, drag or paste in a
<span class="keyword">reaction sub-structure</span>. This is a generic reaction of which all reactants and
products consist of incomplete sub-structures. Their atoms and bond may also contain query features, i.e.
additional conditions for atoms or bonds to be considered a match. Moreover, reactant atoms that exist on
the reaction's product side, should be properly mapped with the reaction editor's mapping tool.</p>
<p>Once a <span class="keyword">reaction sub-structure</span> is defined, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
performes a search in the reaction column to hide those rows, whose reactions don't match the specified reaction.
For that <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> runs a sub-structure search on the reactants and on the products.
Furthermore, it checks, whether sub-structure matches are consistent with the defined atom mapping.</p>

<p align="center"><img width=320 height=224 src="help/img/chem/rssFilter.jpeg"></p>

<p>The reaction filter shown above contains a reaction sub-structure describing an intramolecular
Suzuki reaction. The carbon atoms are decorated with a small 'a', which indicate that they carry a query
feature to match <b>a</b>romatic atoms only. The bond on the product side, which is formed by the reaction,
is marked with the label 'r!a', because two query features define it to be a <b>non-a</b>romatic <b>r</b>ing bond.
Effectively, this makes the reaction an intramolecular one. What can not be seen in the above image,
is that both carbon atoms on the reactant side are mapped to the two product carbon atoms.
The '[4]' indicates an atom list with four atoms. In this case these are Cl,Br,I, and O.</p>
<p>Please note that the example reaction is intentionally incomplete: Both leaving groups, the boronic acid
substituent as well as the halogene/oxygen atom are not drawn on the product side and therefore don't carry atom
mapping numbers.
This is intentional, because in typical reaction collections, these leaving groups are not part of the specified
products either. If we would have included them in the query, then the sub-structure search on the product would
not match those reactions, which are stored without leaving groups.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="RxnSimSearch"></a>Reaction Similarity Search</h3>

<p>If an open <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> window contains a column with chemical reactions,
then this reaction column will typically have an associated <span class="keyword">RxnFp</span> descriptor
in an invisible column. Typically, in this case there will also be a reaction filter among all filters
on the right. If this is missing, you may add it with <span class="menu">Edit->New Filter...</span>,
choose <span class="menu">Reaction [Reaction]</span>, which means 'Reaction'-filter for column 'Reaction',
and press <span class="menu">OK</span>. If the <span class="keyword">RxnFp</span> descriptor doesn't exist,
you may choose <span class="menu">Chemistry->From Chemical Structure->Calculate Descriptor->RxnFp</span>
to generate it.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/basics/reactionFilter.png"></p>

<p>If the filter mode is <span class="menu">is similar to [RxnFp]</span>, then the two sliders
are also active, which let you set similarity thresholds for both, the <span class="keyword">reaction
center</span> and the reaction <span class="keyword">periphery</span>. The reaction center refers to
those reactant and product atoms, which change direct connections to any neighbor atoms.
These may be a broken or newly formed bond or just a change in the bond order. The reaction
<span class="keyword">periphery</span> designates all remaining atoms, those that don't belong to the
<span class="keyword">reaction center</span>.</p>
<p>For reaction similarity filtering not only the reaction column needs to contain a proper atom mapping.
The query reaction used in the filter needs the same. If the query reaction was taken by copy/paste or
drag&drop from a mapped reaction column, then it should be properly mapped. If it, however, was drawn
by hand, then it should be carefully mapped with the editor's mapping tool.</p>
<p>When drawing a reaction, one should usually take care that all reaction center atoms are present
on the reactant and on the product side and that they are properly mapped. However, typical reaction
databases are sometimes incomplete in this regard. Often leaving groups don't show up on the product
list. Small reactants, especially if the solvent serves as reactant as well, are frequently not part
of the explicit reactant list. Examples are methylations of hydroxy groups, where methyl-iodide often
is missing, or deprotection reactions where the protective group disappears into nothing.
For best search results it is advisable to adapt your query style to the dataset you are searching.
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="RetronSearch"></a>Reaction Retron Search</h3>

<p>The <span class="keyword">retron</span> filter offers a simple and yet surprisingly effective reaction
search method. <span class="keyword">Retrons</span> are substructure fragments that occurr on the product
side of the reaction but don't exist among the reactants, thus they must have been built by the reaction.
Different to other reaction search methods, a <span class="keyword">retron</span> search does not even
require searched reactions to me mapped. Since <span class="keyword">retrons</span> are simple sub-structures,
they may also contain atom and bond query features.</p>

<p align="center"><img width=320 height=165 src="help/img/chem/retronFilter.jpeg"></p>

<p>The <span class="keyword">retron</span> filter shown above searches a reaction collection for the
synthesis of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles without any substituent in position 2 and without an attached nitrogen
at position 5.</p>
<p>The only requirement for a <span class="keyword">retron</span> filter to work is that the
<span class="keyword">FragFp</span> descriptor has been generated for both, reactants and products of the
reaction column to be searched. Typically, these descriptors are calculated as default. However, if missing
they may be calculated selecting e.g. <span class="menu">Chemistry->From Chemical Reaction->Calculate
Descriptor->Reactants->FragFp</span>.</p>
<p>In detail the <span class="keyword">retron</span> search algorithm runs a sub-structure search on the
product side and determines how often the particular fragment can be found. If the fragment is found at
least once, then the number of sub-structure matches on the reactant side is determined. If the fragment
is contained more often on the product side, then the reaction is considered a match, because the assumtion
is that this fragment must have been built. Some reactions turn out to be false positive hits, e.g. if a
significant side product as shown beside the main product. If the reaction is mapped, side products can
be identified by their duplicate mapping numbers. Therefore, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
applies a mapping number uniqueness check to remove false positives, if the reactions are mapped.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="FindReplace"></a>Find & Replace with Text and Chemical Structures</h3>
<p>
Usually, <span class="keyword">Find & Replace</span> functionality is performed on text data.
For this purpose the <span class="keyword">Find & Replace</span> dialog (left) lets you select a column,
a text string to be searched for and another piece of text as a replacement string.
You may also choose all empty cells or any cell content to be replaced by a new content.
In addition you may define, whether the replacement shall take place in all rows, or whether
it shall be restricted to visible or selected rows only. This way you may for instance choose
to replace any content of all selected cells with some new content.</p>
<p>When using this dialog to replace text, then the option <span class="menu">Find regex:</span>
allows to specify a <a class="links" href="help/regex.html">regular expression</a> instead of a
simple character sequence to be matched and replaced. Such an expressions may also be used to
define a zero length sub-string being characterized by neighbour characters. This would effectively
insert the replacement string rather than replacing existing chanarcters. An example would be
the expression "(?<=\D)(?=\d)|(?<=\d)(?=\D)", which locates any text position that separates a
digit from a non-digit character. When giving this regex and a space character as the replacement string,
the string "acb123def456" would be changed to "abc 123 def 456".</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/searchReplace.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Find & Replace dialogs for alphanumerial and structure columns.</i></center></p>
<p>If the target column doesn't contain text but chemical structures, then the dialog changes
and shows two substructure fields instead of text fields to define the search and replacement
fragments (dialog on the right). For replacing one substructure by another,
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> needs to know, which attachment points on
the search target match which atoms on the replacement fragment. This is defined by adding R-groups
to both fragments. In oder to replace a phenyl group with a cyclohexyl substituent, one needs
to draw phenyl-R1 and cyclohexyl-R1. Atoms of the search fragment, which don't carry an R-group,
are considered not to carry any more substituents. To define linkers or scaffolds instead of
single bonded substituents one needs to attach two or more R-groups to the search target
and replacement fragment.</p>
<p>If neither search nor replacement fragment carry any R-group, then the search fragment
effectively defines an unconnected structure to be replaced. If in this case the replacement
fragment is kept empty, then the search fragments are just removed from the target structures.</p>
<p>Typical structure related use cases are:
<li>Replace a given scaffold/linker/substituent by another one</li>
<li>Fill empty structures cells with a given structure</li>
<li>Remove certain unwanted fragments, e.g. HCl</li>
<li>Remove all selected structures</li>
</p><br>

<h3><a name="Add2DCoords"></a>Unifying 2D Atom Coordinates</h3>
<p>
Typically, every column that contains chemical structures is accompanied by an invisible column
with 2-dimensional atom coordinates, which allow <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> to
draw chemical structures in their original orientation. When no 2-dimensional atom coordinates exist,
e.g. if an input file contains 3-dimensional coordinates only or if the structures were created
from Smiles codes, then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> creates atom coordinates on the fly
whenever a structure is displayed. If original atom coordinates are not satisfactory or if molecules
with shared scaffolds shall always be drawn with the same scaffold orientation, then one should (re-)generate
new atom coordinates for a given structure column. To create new atom coordinates select
<span class="menu">Generate 2D Atom Coordinates...</span> from the <span class="menu">Chemistry</span> menu.
A dialog opens where one can choose the structure column to be used.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/add2DCoords.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Options for 2D atom coordinate calculation and unification.</i></center></p>
<p>
If no further options are selected and OK is pressed, then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
tries to generate atom coordinates for every structure individually. If, however, as in the example
above, some scaffold are defined, then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> checks every
structure of the selected column, whether it contains any of the given scaffolds. If a scaffold is
found then the corresponding atoms' coordinates are copied from the scaffold and the remaining atoms'
coordinates are optimized around the scaffold without touching the scaffold's orientation.</p>
<p>
If <span class="menu">Automatically detect scaffolds...</span> is selected, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> still considers manually defined scaffolds, if there are any.
In addition it processes all structures, which don't contain manually defined scaffolds.
From these structures it compiles a unique list of unsubstituted scaffolds. Then it generates atom
coordinates for every one of these scaffolds. Afterwards it processes all structures again. Every structure
that contains a scaffold of the list will receive new atom coordinates that contain the scaffold's
optimized coordinates. This ensures that compounds based on the same scaffold are always drawn in
the same orientation.
<br>
The algorithm used for automatic scaffold location can be selected from among these:
<ul>
<li><span class="menu">Most central ring system</span>: Imagine one removes all atoms and bonds that
are not part of any ring of a given molecule. In this case we retain all separated and unsubstituted
ring systems of this molecule. The most central ring system is the one that is topologically closest
to the center of the molecule.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Murcko scaffold</span>: If we locate all ring systems of a molecule and add all
atoms and bonds that directly connect different ring systems, and remove all other bonds and atoms,
we retain the so-called Murcko scaffold. Basically it is the original molecule with all substituents
removed that do not contain any ring.</li>
</ul>
Both options require the existence of at least one ring in the molecule. In molecules that don't
contain rings no scaffold is found. Hence, newly created coordinates for these molecules won't be
influenced by the list of found scaffolds.

<h3><a name="CompareFiles"></a>Comparing Structure Files</h3>
<p>
Sometimes one needs to compare two rather big sets of compounds for overlaps, i.e. for
compounds within one set, which have (or don't have) a similar or equal counterpart in the other set.
Potential use cases may be:<ul>
<li>locating commercially available compounds, which are substancially dissimilar to any compound
of an existing screening library. In a second step one might purchase a subset of those compounds
that matches a desired physico-chemical property profile.</li>
<li>a virtual screening for those commercially available compounds, which are similar to at least
one of a known set of bioactive compounds. Both, chemical or flexophore similarity may be useful
in this case.</li>
<li>checking a commercial compound set against an in-house collection for equals considering
tautomers and different salts as being equal.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>This task compares all compounds of the currently active <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
window with any compound of another specified compound file. This compound comparison may either
use a descriptor similarity or it may be an exact compund match, which may or may not include
other stereo-isomers, tautomers and/or salts.</p>
<p>The comparison results may be used in various ways. First, the open window will receive a new column
containing the most similar structure of the other file and another new column containing the
similarity value. Optionally, one may select more information from the external file to be included
into new columns of the open window, e.g. a compound identifier. Second, one may also create new files
containing all similar structures or all dissimilar structure from the external file. And third,
one may write all compared compound pairs or just the similar ones into a new file.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/compareFiles.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Options for locating (dis-)similar compounds between two files.</i></center></p>
<p><b>File:</b> Click <span class="menu">Choose</span> to select the external structure file,
which the active window's structures shall be compared to. This file may also be the
very file that was opened to show the active window.</p>
<p><b>Structure column & comparison method:</b> One may choose either a descriptor of a chemical
structure column or the <span class="menu">[Exact]</span> method. In the first case a similarity
slider will let you define a similarity limit, while with the latter option you may select, whether
to neglect stereo-, tautomer-, and/or salt information, when doing an otherwise exact structure
match. You may only choose among those descriptors, which already exist in your open window.
If an external file does not contain the selected descriptor then it is calculated on the fly.</p>
<p><b>Similarity limit:</b> This defines the similarity threshold above which two compounds
are considered similar. If a compound of the open DataWarrior window has similar counterpart(s)
above this limit, then the most similar of these structures will be shown in a new column of the
active window. If a compound pair file is written, then this will include pairs only, if their
similarity is above this threshold. The similarity slider is visible only, if a descriptor
is selected in the option above.</p>
<p><b>Neglect stereo features, Consider tautomers equal, Consider largest fragment only:</b>
In case of an exact structure match, these options allow to weaken the compound comparison
by considering any stereo-isomers, any tautomers, and/or any salts of otherwise equal compounds
as still being equal. These options are only available, if an <span class="menu">[Exact]</span>
comparison is selected above.</p>
<p><b>Select columns:</b> This allows to select columns from the compared file, which
shall be included as new columns into the current window and populated with the respective
information of the most similar compound for each row.</p>
<p><b>Save similar compounds to file:</b> Select this to define a file name for storing
all compounds of the external file that are found to be similar to any of the current window's
compounds.</p>
<p><b>Save dissimilar compounds to file:</b> Select this to define a file name for storing
all compounds of the external file that are not found to be similar to any of the current window's
compounds.</p>
<p><b>Save similar compound pairs to file:</b> Select this to define a file name for storing
all compound pairs that are more similar than the defined similarity limit.</p>
<p><b>Compound-ID of this dataset:</b> Here you may select a column from the active window
containing compound identifiers, which will be written into the compound pair file.</p>
<p><b>Compound-ID of external file:</b> Here you may select a column from the external
file containing compound identifiers, which will be written into the compound pair file.</p>
<p><b>Create half matrix:</b> This option is only available, if the active window's content was
read from the same file that it is compared against. If this option is selected,
then only half of the similarity matrix is processed, because this already covers all
possible compound pair combinations.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="SelectDiverse"></a>Selecting Diverse Compounds from Large Set</h3>
<p>
This function is an efficient implementation for locating a most diverse subset
within a given set of molecules. The algorithm can be preloaded with a second
set of molecules, causing the algorithm to select molecules, which are both, most
different to any molecule in the secons set and highly diverse among the selection.
Especially for this reason, this function is perfectly suited to select diverse
screening compounds from a provider's catalog avoiding any compound being similar
to already available in-house compounds.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/selectDiverseDialog.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Dialog configured to select 50000 diverse compound different to currentLibrary.dwar.</i></center></p>
<p>All binary descriptors can be used with this algorithm. After computing the
desired number of diverse compounds a column is added to the dataset with ascending
numbers indicating selected compounds. The compound with number 1 is that compounds,
which is most different to all the others. Compound number 2 is most different from
number 1. Compound 3 is the one most different to 1 and 2 and so forth. If a dataset
contains a few awkward compounds, then these are likely to be picked first. Therefore,
in reality one would often skip the very first compounds of the diverse selection.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ClusterCompounds"></a>Clustering Compounds</h3>
<p>Clustering is an old cheminformatics technique for subdividing a typically large
compound collection into small groups of similar compounds. Clustering was used in
the old days, when computational resources were expensive, to precompute similarity
relationships between compounds. Cluster membership could be stored easily in databases
to be quickly retrieved later, whenever the need arose to locate similar structures
to any given structure, e.g. after a high-throughput screening. The inherent problem
of clustering is that cluster borders are arbitrary and may separate very similar
compounds into different clusters. Therefore, the retrieval of all cluster co-member
of a given compound does not necessarily result in the most similar compounds.</p>

<p>The cluster algorithm implemented in <i>DataWarrior</i> is simple, reproducible,
but computationally demanding and, therefore, best used if the dataset doesn't
contain far beyond 10000 compounds. First the complete similarity matrix is calculated,
which can be done with any descriptor. Then, in a stepwise process the most similar
compounds or clusters are merged to form a new cluster, whose similarity to the
remaining compounds and clusters is re-calculated as a weighted mean from its members.
The merging process continues until a stop criterion is met. Stop criteria can be
defined in the cluster dialog.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/clusterDialog.jpeg"></p>

<p>The clustering process may be defined to stop when the cluster count reaches
a desired number or when the similarity needed to join two clusters falls below
a definable limit. If both criteria are defined, then the clustering stops if any
of both criteria are met.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="MolecularProperties"></a>Calculating Molecular Properties</h3>

<p><i>DataWarrior</i> may calculate or estimate various properties directly from
the chemical structure. These include physico-chemical properties,
lead- or drug-likeness related parameters, ligand efficiencies, various atom and
ring counts, molecular shape, flexibility and complexity as well as indications
for potential toxicity. After calculating properties, these are automatically
added as new columns to the data table. If chemical structures contain small
disconnected fragments as water molecules or counter ions, then these are removed
before the property calculaten, i.e. properties are always calculated for the largest
fragment only. An exception are the total molweight and the number of disconnected
fragments, which both refer to the unstripped input structure.</p>
<p>To calculate any molecular properties from chemical structures select
<span class="menu">Add Compound Properties...</span> from the <span class="menu">
Chemistry</span> menu. Select the properties of interest from one or more
property sections and click <span class="menu">OK</span>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/properties.jpeg"></p>

<p>Properties related to the ligand efficiency are based on IC50 values and require
the selection of a corresponding numerical column that contains IC50-values.</p>
<p>Some properties match those available in the <i>OSIRIS Property Explorer</i>,
which was made public in 2000 and in now downloadable on www.openmolecules.org.
Some of these properties and the algorithms used are explained in more detail
<a href="help/../properties/properties.html">here</a>.</p> 
<br>

<h3><a name="VirtualLibraries"></a>Enumerating Virtual Libraries</h3>

<p>DataWarrior can generate all structures of a virtual combinatorial library, given that a
<span class="keyword">generic reaction</span> is defined and that for every one of its generic reactants
a list of real reactant structures is provided. Enumerated product structures may then be used
for many purposes, such as predicting physico-chemical properties, running pharmacophore searches,
or docking them as potential ligands structures into a pocket of a protein structure.
Products structures with the most promising properties may then be selected for synthesis.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">Generic reactions</span> consist of chemical sub-structures that define
compatible reactants and created product(s) of a reaction. The reactant side often contains atom and bond
query features. Especially, <a href="help/chemistry.html#excludeGroups">exclude groups</a> are frequently
used to more specifically define chemical functionality to guide chemical reactivity and compatibility issues.
<span class="keyword">Generic reactions</span> should also contain atom mapping information, which
assigns product atoms to reactant atoms and this way serves as a transformation description of how
to construct the product from the reactants in term of which bonds are broken, formed, or changed.
Ideally, reactant structures carry query features restrictive enough that, if used within a substucture
search in a building block database, only such molecules would be retrieved, which would react under
typical reaction conditions.</p>

<p>To create a virtual library, select <span class="menu">Enumerate Combinatorial Library...</span>
from the <span class="menu">Chemistry</span> menu. To start you may select one of the predefined templates,
which are taken from Hartenfeller's published<a href="help/chemistry.html#litCCLib"><sup>1</sup></a>
collection of robust organic reactions. Or you may copy/paste or drag&drop a reaction from somewhere else,
or draw one yourself.
You may also load a reaction from a reaction file in <span class="keyword">RXN</span> format. Note that
<span class="keyword">RXN</span>-files created by <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
are compatible with other applications, but include a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
specific reaction encoding, which ensures that all query features are exactly reproduced,
when the files is re-opened again by <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>. Some of
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior's</span> query features as <span class="keyword">exclude groups</span>
are not supported by standard <span class="keyword">RXN</span>-files.</p>

<p align="center"><img width=600 height=430 src="help/img/chem/reactionEditor.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Generic reaction with selected mapping tool and mapping numbers visible.</i></p>

<p>If you decide to draw a new generic reaction yourself, then you may follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Draw all needed atoms and bonds of all reactants and product(s) to properly define the reaction.
Typically, at least those atoms must be drawn, which change their bonding throughout the reaction.</li>
<li>Please make sure that all atoms, which exist on the reactant and the product side, get properly mapped using the
mapping tool <img src="help/../editor/mappingTool.gif">.</li>
<li>You may use query features and <span class="keyword">exclude groups</span> on the generic reactant side
to constrain reactant structures. This is done for two reasons: First, the reactant (sub-)structure
is used to discard non-qualifying reactant molecules, when opening a reactant file. Second, more closely
defined reactant structures help the reactor to identify the correct functional group within a molecule,
if there are multiple similar groups.
</li>
<li>You may save your generic reaction for later re-use.</li>
</ul>
Once the <span class="keyword">generic reaction</span> is defined, click on <span class="menu">Reactants</span>
to switch from the reaction to the reactant panel.</p>

<p align="center"><img width=600 height=302 src="help/img/chem/reactantDialog.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Imported reactant structures for two generic reactants.</i></p>

<p>You may load reactant structures from a file using the <span class="menu">Open File...</span> button.
In this case an automatic sub-structure search ensures that only those molecules are used, which contain
the defined generic reactant. In addition or alternatively, you may add or change reactant structures
using drag&drop or copy/paste. A right mouse click within the structure area opens a popup menu that lets
you add, remove and edit individual structures. Once all reactant structures are defined, you may start the
enumeration by clicking <span class="menu">OK</span>.</p>

<p>When creating the product structures, <i>DataWarrior</i> retains the atom coordinates
of the generic product. Therefore all products are later shown in the expected orientation.
After all product structures have been created, <i>DataWarrior</i> creates some default
views. Now you may calculate physico-chemical properties for all virtual products,
calculate Flexophore similarities, generate conformers, cluster the products or run
some other kind of analysis.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Usually, query features are used on the reactant's side only.
However, if you use query features on a reactant bond to allow multiple bond orders and if you draw
the respective product bond without defining multiple bond orders, then the product is constructed with the
explicitly drawn bond order, no matter whether any used reactant molecules have a single, double or triple bond
at that position. In order to tell the reactor to retain the original reactant molecule's bond order,
you need to assign to the product bond the same bond types that you have defined for the reactant bond.
You may even define a bond order increase or decrease for bonds with multiple allowed bond types, e.g. by assigning
<i>single or double</i> to a reactant bond and <i>double or triple</i> to the respective product bonds.</p>

<h3><a name="EvolutionaryLibraries"></a>Generating Evolutionary Libraries</h3>

<p>Chemical space is huge. There are estimates that the number of distinct, stable molecular
structures with a molecular weight in the drug-like range is about 10<sup>60</sup>.
It will never be possible to compute all these structures to search them for the one
with the most promising property profile for a particular purpose. Nevertheless,
fishing for unknown promising structures in this vast compound space may be successful
if the approach is right. It may then lead to completely new ideas or starting points, which
would not be possible with the traditional structurally constrained virtual screening
of existing or virtual combinatorial libraries.</p>

<p>Computational methods are called <span class="keyword">De Novo Drug Design</span>, if
they aim for suggesting entirely new molecules, which are supposedly active on a chosen drug target.
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses an <span class="keyword">evolutionary algorithm</span>
for this purpose, which somewhat mimicks nature's evolution of plants and animals. The algorithm starts
with a small initial set of molecules called the <span class="keyword">first generation</span>.
From any of these molecules it creates multiple derived, new, but similar molecules by applying a
small random structure modification. All derived structures together form the first offspring generation,
which is much larger that its parent one. In detail the algorithm uses structure
modifications like single atom replacements, atom insertions, bond order changes, substituent migrations,
ring aromatisations, etc. These modifications are selected randomly from a large list of possible changes.</p>

<p>However, the probability values for this random selection and, therefore, the likelyhood that a certain
modification is selected, also depends on another factor. When the list of all modifications is built,
then the change is evaluated in regard to as how much it increases or decreases the structure's
<i>drug-likeness</i> (or optionally <i>natural-product-likeness</i>). Modifications that increase the
<i>drug-likeness</i> are assigned a higher probability than mutations that decrease it.
Changes, which would create high ring strains are removed from the list. These modulation of modification
propabilities ensures that the algorithm stays in the chemical space of drug-like (or natural-product-like)
compounds.</p>

<p>In a next step the algorithm applies customizable fitness criteria to rank the new generation's molecules
according to these criteria. The highest ranking molecules from this generation are selected to survive
and form the parent molecules for the next generation.
Typically, after a few hundred molecule generations <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
has arrived at structures that optimally match the defined fitness criteria.</p>

<p>You may define multiple fitness criteria in the <i>Evolutionaly Library Dialog</i>. Criteria may
be weighted to make them more or less important than others. Together all defined criterial build the
desired compound property profile.

For simple properties one may define an optimal
numerical range. One may also require compounds to be similar or dissimilar to
a definable set of compounds using any descriptor. All individual fitness criteria
can be weighted to make them more or less important than others.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/fitness.jpeg"></p>

<p>In the fitness example above we look for compounds, whose chemical structure is
dissimilar to any of three known inhibitors, while at the same time being similar
to at least one of these inhibitors considering flexophore similarity. In other
words, we are looking for compounds with a similar target binding behaviour, but
with a dissimilar chemical structure to the known inhibitors.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/eLibrary.jpeg"></p>

<p>The picture above shows the <span class="menu">General</span> panel
of the dialog after starting the evolutionary process. As starting point the
structure of LDS has been selected, which is as good as any other starting point.
The type of compounds being created is set to <span class="menu">natural products</span>.
We see the structure of the currently mutated parent molecule, the molecules in the
current generation and the overall best ranking molecule. The background color
of these molecules reflect how well the fitness portfolio is already met.
Any time during the evolution process one may click <span class="menu">Stop</span>
to create a new document with the fittest structures of all generations.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="RandomMolecules"></a>Generating Random Molecules</h3>

<p>There have been a few recent publications describing <span class="keyword">Long Short-Term Memory</span>
(LSTM) networks to generate SMILES codes representing new random molecules.
Typically, these networks are trained with large text files containing
thousands of SMILES encoded drug-like molecular structures. LSTM networks, when trained with
a sequence of characters, learn the propability of specific characters to follow after a sequence
of previous characters. Thus, a network being trained with thousands of SMILES codes, can make
reasonable suggestions for the next character when presented with a starting part of a SMILES code.
This way it may be used to construct new SMILES codes from scratch, which are composed of
patterns that the network has seen during the training phase. Since LSTM networks cannot understand
the grammar of SMILES, they produce a certain percentage of invalid SMILES codes, which must be
filtered out in a second step. The major cause for invalid SMILES are atom labels consisting
of two atoms, aromaticity encoding by non-capital letters, the encoding of ring closures with
two matching digits, and the need to match every open parenthesis with a closing one for substituents.
Suggestions have been made to overcome some of these problems by changing the SMILES grammar for
this purpose. However, a principal problem remains: LSTM networks are not optimal for polycyclic
structures, because the underlying data structure is just a sequence of characters.</p>

<p><span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> uses a different principle for the generation of
random structures: Starting from a methane molecule it performs many random mutations on the molecule
until the its size reaches a desired molecular weight range. These mutations include
atom additions, atom insertions, ring closures, border order changes, atom changes, atom removal,
and similar small modifications of the molecular structure. The algorithms favors mutations,
which cause drug-like (or natural-product-like) sub-structures. It also prefers changes that
let the molecule grow until its non-hydrogen atom count reaches a desired range.</p>

<p>Optionally one may define a structure to start with. In addition one may select a part of the
starting structure, which would then be protected against mutations. This selected substructure
would then be retained during molecule growth and, thus, would exists as substructure within every
generated random molecule. To open the dialog for defining the random molecule generation process

<p><b>Nitrogen and oxygen bias:</b> These slider let you increase to decrease the likelyhood

<p><b>Seed compound:</b> This defines that starting molecule for the algorithm. If you intend
to generate molecules with a certain substructure, then you need to draw a start molecule that
contains this substructure and at least one more atom. Then use the lasso tool to select the
substructure, which causes the algorithm to protect its atoms and bonds from being mutated.
All generated molecules will then contains the selected substructure.</p>

<p><b>Molecule count:</b> The number of molecules being generated.</p>

<p><b>Minimum and maximum non-H atom count:</b> These fields will influence the size of
the generated molecules by defining a desired range of non-hydrogen atom counts.</p>

will be evenly distributed within the defined range, or whether the majority of generated
molecules will have non-H counts being around the middle of the defined range.</p>

<h3><a name="ScaffoldAnalysis"></a>Analysing Scaffolds</h3>

<p>The <i>Scaffold Analysis</i> locates the core structure(s) of every molecule within a
given column and creates a new column that contains these scaffolds. The method used to
locate the core structure(s) depends on the chosen <span class="menu">Scaffold type</span>:

<ul><li><span class="menu">Plain ring systems</span>: This mode locates all single ring
and annelated ring systems without any substituents.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Ring systems with substitution pattern</span>: This mode works
as the previous one, but marks every ring atom as being substituted, which carries an
exeo-cyclic, non-hydrogen substituent in the original molecule.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Ring systems with carbon/hetero subst. pattern</span>: This
mode goes a step further by distinguishing, whether a substituent's first atom was a
carbon atom or a hetero atom.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Ring system with atomic-no subst. pattern</span>: This mode
is even more specific. Every exocyclic substituent is represented by its first atom.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Murcko scaffold</span>:The <i>Murcko scaffold</i>
contains all plain ring systems of the given molecule plus all direct connections
between them. Substituents, which don't contain ring systems are removed from rings and
ring connecting chains.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Murcko skeleton</span>: The <i>Murcko skeleton</i> is a
generalized <i>Murcko scaffold</i>, which has all hetero atoms replaced by carbon atoms.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Most central ring system</span>: As the name implies, this is
that ring system of the molecule, which is closest to its topological center. It does not
contain any exocyclic substitution information.</li></ul></p>

<p>The image below illustrated the different scaffold modes. The original molecule
structure is shown at the top middle position. The scaffold structures produced by any
of the seven scaffold modes are shown around the original molecule.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/scaffolds.jpeg"></p>

<p>If the <span class="menu">Save scaffold frequency file</span> option is selected, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> creates a new document listing all detected scaffold
and their occurence frequency. The name and location of the scaffold file can be set
after pressing the <span class="menu">Choose</span> button.</p>

<br>

<h3><a name="SARTables"></a>Creating SAR-Tables</h3>

<p><i>Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR)</i> Tables are frequently used to
correlate biological properties with the substitution patterns of compound sets
that share one or a few chemical scaffolds and often have been synthesised
in a combinatorial fashion. If a dataset contains chemical structures,
<i>DataWarrior</i> may decompose the structures by analysing scaffold and substituents
and putting them into new dedicated columns.
This can be done either fully automatic or a little more flexible with some user guidance.
Similar functionality of this kind is sometime called <i>R-group-decomposition</i> or
<i>R-group-deconvolution</i>.</p>

<p>To automatically create a <span class="keyword">SAR-Table</span> from your dataset,
select <span class="menu">Automatic SAR-Analysis...</span> from the
<span class="menu">Chemistry</span> menu. A dialog lets you choose the mechanism
that is used to determine the scaffold.
<ul><li><span class="menu">Most central ring system</span>: As the name implies, with
this option that ring system of the molecule, which is closest to the topological center
of the molecule, is taken as the scaffold.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Murcko scaffold</span>: The <i>Murcko scaffold</i> of a molecule
is determined by locating all ring systems of the molecule and all direct connections
between them. Everything else is considered as substituents.</li>
</ul>
Compounds without any rings are not subjected to the analysis and their cells
in the new columns remain empty.</p>

<p>If you need more flexibility in determining, which sub-structures should be considered
the central scaffold, then you should select <span class="menu">Core based SAR-Analysis...</span>
from the <span class="menu">Chemistry</span> menu. The dialog lets you define a sub-structure
that may include query features. By using atom wild cards or variable bond bridges,
one drawn sub-structure may detect multiple different scaffolds at once. Nevertheless,
often the <span class="menu">Core based SAR-Analysis...</span> function needs to be
used multiple times to process all scaffolds in the dataset.</p>

<p>Whatever mode you use to generate a <span class="keyword">SAR-Table</span>,
for every different scaffold, the entire dataset is processed to find those scaffold atoms,
which have variations concerning their substituents they carry. For all of these, a
generic R-group is attached to the scaffold. If a scaffold atom is always carrying the
same substituent, this substituent is attached to the scaffold. The scaffold with attached
R-groups and substituents is called <span class="keyword">core-fragment</span> and
put into the first new table column. New R-group columns are added according to the needs.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/SARResult.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Table view with new columns added after SAR-Analysis</i></center></p>

<p>After a SAR-analysis, this means after the separation of numbered substituents (R-groups)
from the scaffold structure, it may be useful to re-unite some of the R-group columns
with the scaffold. This may allows better investigate or visualize the influence of
the remaining substituents. This can be done using the
</span><a href="help/data.html#MergeColumns">Merging Columns</a> functionality.</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="SimAnalysis"></a>Similarity Analysis</h3>

<p>In the recent literature<a href="help/chemistry.html#litSimAnalysis"><sup>1-3</sup></a> the terms
<i>Molecular Similarity Analysis</i>, <i>Activity Cliff Analysis</i>
or <i>Activity Landscape</i> are hot topics. All these related methods have in common that they usually
start with a 2-dimensional scaling process of the chemical space, which means that all involved molecules
are positioned somehow on a 2D-area, such that similar molecules are located close to each other.
This scaling could be done by running a <i>principal component analysis (PCA)</i> on a descriptor of
the molecules and using the first two components as coordinates.
Another approach would be a <i>self organizing map (SOM)</i> from a descriptor. Both of these options are
limited in terms of the descriptor type, because they require input data to be vector, i.e. a binary or numerical
array of data.</p>
<p>While <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> allows running PCAs or SOMs on descriptor vectors and
visualizing the results as a chemical landscape, the <span class="keyword">Similarity Analysis</span>
is based on a different method. It uses a
<span class="keyword">Rubberbanding Forcefield</span><a href="help/chemistry.html#litSimAnalysis"><sup>4</sup></a>
approach, which translates similarity better than a PCA, is faster than a SOM, uses the available space more
efficiently and works with any type of similarity criterion including the
<span class="keyword">Flexophore descriptor</span>.</p>
<p>The approach involves the following steps:<ul>
<li>randomly position all molecules on the 2D space</li>
<li>calculate the entire similarity matrix between all molecules</li>
<li>locate most similar neighbors to be considered for every molecule</li>
<li>between any two neighbors assume attractive forces, which increase with similarity and distance</li>
<li>stepwise relocate all molecules parallel to the mean vector of perceived forces</li>
<li>while attractive forces decrease over time and due to lower distances, introduce increasing short range
repelling forces among all molecules</li>
</ul></p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/orgFuncSimAnalysis.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Three default views after similarity analysis</i></center></p>

<p>When DataWarrior has finished the calculation of molecule positions, it creates three new default views:
<ul><li>A view depicting the chemical space of all molecules. Similar neighbors are connected with a
connecting line and the markers that represent the molecules are colored dynamically by molecule similarity
to the chosen <span class="keyword">Reference Molecule</span>, which changes whenever you click another marker.</li>
<li>A tree view that shows the direct neighbors of the chosen <span class="keyword">Reference Molecule</span>.
When a marker or molecule is clicked on in any view, the <span class="keyword">Reference Molecule</span>
changes and the tree view's content is dynamically updated to show the neighborhood of the new molecule.</li>
<li>A structure view, which is configured to show selected molecules on top, while the non-selected ones
are grayed out. The highlight mode of the respective structures column is set to
<span class="keyword">Reference Row Similarity</span>, causing any displayed molecule to show any structural
differences to the molecule of the <span class="keyword">Reference Row</span>. Structural elements possessed
by the reference molecule, which are not part of the depicted molecule, are shown in red. Structural elements
of the shown molecule, which are not present in the reference molecule, are highlighted with a blue background.
To change the selection of displayed molecules, you simply need to select different markers in the tree view
or on the similarity map.</li>

<h3><a name="SaliAnalysis"></a>Activity Cliff Analysis</h3>
<p>The <span class="keyword">Activity Cliff Analysis</span> uses the same mechanism already explained
in the previous section to create a similarity map of all involved molecules. It also detects all
similarity relationships between them above an automatically determined similarity threshold. To be precise,
this is not a global cutoff value, but is modulated from molecule to molecule. Depending on the neighborhood
situation of an individual molecules the threshold may be increased or decreased to accound for many very
similar or few not even similar neighbors. This reduces singletons and untangles large clusters to some extend.</p>
<p>In addition to the <span class="keyword">Similarity Analysis</span> the so-called <span class="keyword">
Structure-Activity Landscape Index (SALI)</span> is calculated for all pairs of similar molecules.
If two molecules with measured activities a1 and a2 and their structural similarity being s,
then the SALI value between these molecules is defined as SALI = |a1-a2| / (1-s). The SALI value is a measure
of how much activity is gained (or lost) with a relatively small change in structure. Molecule pairs
that show an abrupt change in activity despite having a rather similar structure are called activity cliffs.
These pairs are particularly interesting, if one tries to understand structure-activity relationships
in order to design new structural motives with improved activities.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/saliView.jpeg"></p>
<p>After an <span class="keyword">Activity Cliff Analysis</span> the generated similarity view
encodes SALI values and activites in marker size and marker color, respectively.
The image above shows a part of such a similarity map. In this case the dataset contained EC50 values
on Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. The marker background color reflects the receptor subtypes
(CB1:pink, CB2: orange). One can easily recognize clusters of similar compounds, locate active compounds
(red markers), locate activity cliffs (large markers), and even distinguish CB1 from CB2 inhibitors.</p>

<h3><i><a name="SALIAnalysisConfig"></a>Configuring And Running A Similarity Or Activity Cliff Analysis</i></h3>
<p>
To perform a <span class="keyword">Similarity or Activity Cliff Analysis</span> choose
<span class="menu">Analyse Similarity/Activity Cliffs...</span> from the <span class="menu">Chemistry</span>
menu. The following dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/chem/simAnalysisDialog.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Similarity Analysis Dialog</i></center></p>
<p><b>Similarity on:</b> Defines the similarity criterion, i.e. the descriptor that is used for arranging
molecules on the 2D-map. One may use any descriptor that <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> knows of,
provided that is has been calculated previously for the current data file. Most useful descriptors are
<span class="keyword">SkelSpheres</span> for fine-grained chemical graph similarity,
<span class="keyword">OrgFunctions</span> for similarity on synthetically relevant organic functionality,
and <span class="keyword">Flexophore</span> to create a molecule map based on the similarity of protein binding
characteristics.</p>
<p><b>Activity column:</b> For a <span class="keyword">Similarity Analysis</span> don't select a column here.
For an <span class="keyword">Activity Cliff Analysis</span> you need to select that
column that contains the numerical value to calculate SALI values from. For any pair of molecules the SALI
value reflects how much activity is gained with a small change of the chemical structure. Very high SALI
values identify activity cliffs, i.e. those rare points in an activity landscape, where a small change of the
chemical structure causes a large change in activity (or any other experimentally determined molecule property.
Identifying these molecule pairs and understanding the structural cause of the activity change can be very
helpful in the process of designing compounds with better properties.</p>
<p><b>Identifier column:</b> The <span class="keyword">Similarity or Activity Cliff Analysis</span> detects
for evey molecule its most similar neighbor molecules and writes a reference to those molecules into a new column.
Therefore it needs a column that contains a key that uniquely identifies a molecule or data row. If your data
contains compound identifiers you may select that column. Otherwise, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
will create a new number for that purpose.</p>
<p><b>Separate groups by:</b> In some cases one column contains data experimental data refering to
multiple targets or measured under different conditions. If a second column contains categories describing
the conditions, and if only values within the same category can be compared to each other, then you should
select the category column here. Then SALI value will only be calculated from compatible experimental values.</p>
<p><b>Similarity limit:</b> Usually <span class="menu">Automatic</span> does a good job. However, if you
prefer getting more or less neighborship relationships than the automatic process generates, then you may
disable the automatic setting and (moderately) update the threshold defining slider. If the limit is set too
high then this may cause the 2D-scaling find too little similarity relationships. The final map may then not
be much different from the initial state of randomly scattered molecules. If the limit is
set to low and therefore too many similarity pairs are found, then a highly interconnected bunch of molecules
won't equilibrate well.</p>
<p><b>Create view based on similarity relationships:</b> If this option is checked, a similarity map of all
molecules is created. Therefore a <span class="keyword">Rubberbanding Forcefield</span> is employed to
incrementally equilibrate 2D-coordinates for all molecules until an energy minimum is reached and all
molecules are positioned close to their most similar neighbors. Afterwards a 2D-view is created to visualize
the similarity map.</p>
<p><b>Create document of structure pairs:</b> If this option is checked, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> creates a new document in an open window, which contains all
detected similarity relationships in dedicated rows. Two columns contain the two neighbor molecules;
additional columns contain molecule identifiers, similarity, activities, and SALI values.</p>
