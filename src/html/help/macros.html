<h2><a name="UsingMacros"></a>Using Macros for Workflow Automation</h2>
<hr align="left" size="2" width="550">

<p>Workflow based cheminformatics tools like <i>Pipeline Pilot</i> or <i>Knime</i> gained quite some
popularity, because they allow defining complicated or long task sequences, which can be executed
at a later time multiple times by different people on different or frequently updated data.<br>
In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> a defined sequence of tasks is called
<span class="keyword">macro</span>. In <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> new macros can be created
by creating and defining macro tasks one-by-one interactively, by duplicating and customizing an existing macro,
or simply by recording normal user interactions. These include creating or changing views,
filtering data, calculating properties, retrieving data from databases, opening and saving files, and much more.
Basically, any action that can be done interactively can also be defined as macro task. In addition there
exist some special macro tasks that cannot be performed interactively.<br>
Most macro related functionality are accessible through the <span class="menu">Macro</span> menu, which
allows recording, playing, exporting and importing macros. 
A dedicated macro editor view lets you create new or customize existing macros. Finally, macro files
can be opened from the file menu or by double-clicking their icons to immediately run them.
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Concepts"></a>Macro Concepts</h3>
<p>
In order to efficiently work with macros, one needs to understand a few general concepts:<br>
<li>Typically a macro is owned by a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> document. When this document is saved,
the macro is saved as part of the document's <i>.dwar</i> file.</li>
<li>When a new macro is created, either manually within the macro editor or by recording a macro, then the macro
belongs to that document, whose window was in front during the macro's creation.</li>
<li>When a longer macro is recorded it may happen that the window, which owns the macro, is pushed to the background,
e.g. when a task creates a new window. In that case user interactions happen in the new front window,
but are still added to original macro, which belongs to the background window.</li>
<li>If a macro is executed, then every one of its tasks is executed in the front window, even if the macro is owned by
another window that is in the background.</li>
<li>Macros may be exported into a dedicated <i>.dwam</i> file. Usually, this is done to share the macro with other users or
to store it independent of a data file for future use.</li>
<li>When a <i>.dwam</i> file icon is double-clicked or the file is opened from <span class="keyword">DataWarrior's</span>
<span class="menu">File</span> menu, then the contained macro is executed on the front window's dataset.</li>
<li>Macro files, which are located in certain predefined directories, are listed in the <span class="menu">Macro</span>
menu for direct execution.</li>
<li>Macros can call other macros recursively.</li>
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="RecordAndRun"></a>Recording and Running Macros</h3>
<p>
The easy way to create a macro is recording one. To do so, activate that window, which shall host the new macro and
select <span class="menu">Start Recording...</span> from the <span class="menu">Macro</span> menu.
A dialog opens to ask for a macro name. After closing that dialog a red message in the bottom right corner of
every window indicates that all interactions with <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> are currently recorded
as tasks of a new macro until you select <span class="menu">Stop Recording</span> from the <span class="menu">Macro</span> menu.
Once a macro was recorded its name appears in the <span class="menu">Run Macro</span> and <span class="menu">Export Macro</span>
items of the <span class="menu">Macro</span> menu. 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/macros/messages.jpeg"><br>
<i>A macro is currently being recorded or executed.</i></center></p>
<p>
In order to execute a macro select its name from the <span class="menu">Macro -> Run Macro</span> menu.
Then, the macro's tasks will be sequentially executed in the front-most window, which may change during the execution
of the macro, if a task brings another window to the front or if a new window is created. During the execution
of the macro a message and a progress bar in the bottom right corner of every window report on the progress of
individual tasks. An <span class="menu">X</span> button can be pressed anytime to stop a macro's execution immediately
(see image above).</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="Editor"></a>The Macro Editor</h3>
<p>
While it is convenient to just record a new macro by naturally interacting with DataWarrior, sometimes it is
necessary to slightly adapt a recorded macro or even useful to create a new macro from scratch. Moreover,
there are tasks, which cannot be recorded, e.g. for showing a message or waiting for a few seconds.
To change an existing macro or to construct a new one from scratch <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
has built-in macro editor view, which can be opened with a right mouse click on any view's title area and
selecting <span class="menu">New Macro Editor</span> from the popup menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="help/img/macros/editor.jpeg"></p>
<p><center><i>Macro Editor</i></center></p>
<p>The left part of the editor shows all task categories and tasks that are available in <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>.
At the top of the right part one may create macros, rename of delete existing macros from the current data file. If the
active <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> window contains macros, one may select one for editing. All tasks
of the selected macro are then shown below in the order they will be executed. Available tasks can be dragged and dropped
from the left into a macro's task list, which causes a new task of this kind to be added or inserted into the currently macro.
If the task needs further specification, which most tasks do, then a dialog opens to define the task's details.
Any time later one may double click any task of a macro to open the detail dialog again. A right mouse click of
a macro task opens a popup menu allowing to rename or remove the task. The task order can be changed by dragging
tasks to a different position.</p>
<p>Note that the dialog for editing a macro task may look and behave slightly different from the dialog to configure
the same task for immediate execution on the current window's dataset. When you edit a macro task,
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> cannot know the structure of the data, which the macro will run on.
Nor does it know, which views or filters will be available. Therefore, a higher flexibility is needed for specifying
a particular data column, a view or a filter. To allow for this higher flexibility dialog items often permit typing in a
column name in addition to selecting one from a list of compatible columns.
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="ImportExport"></a>Exporting and Importing Macros</h3>
<p>
When a new macro is born by either creating it in the macro editor or by recording user interactions, then the macro belongs
to the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> document that was in front, when the macro creation was started. Whenever
a document window is in front that contains macros, then its <span class="menu">Run Macro</span> menu allows to execute
any of the document's internal macros. This way the initial scope of any new macro is more or less limited to the data file
it belongs to. In order to share a macro with a colleague or to make it available to all data files, it needs to be detached,
i.e. exported from its original data file. When selecting the macro's name from the <span class="menu">Export Macro</span> menu,
then the macro is written into a dedicated file that can be sent to a colleague, or converted into a global macro by putting
it into a directory, which is scanned by <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> during launch (see next section).<br>
Likewise, macro files can be imported into any <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> document to quasi marry them with it.
This is done by selecting <span class="menu">Import Macro...</span> from the <span class="menu">Macro</span> menu.
Whenever a document with embedded macros is opened, the names of its macros appear in the <span class="menu">Run Macro</span>
submenu for immediate execution.
</p>
<p>
Macro files are text files with a simple format. They basically contain a macro name and a sequential list of task.
Tasks also have a name identyfiable by <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> and a list of properties, which define
what exactly the task is supposed to do. If you have a little experience, you may use a text editor to adapt a macro
to your needs. For convenience reasons <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> allows to copy/paste macros in text form
using <span class="menu">Copy Macro</span> and <span class="menu">Paste Macro</span> from the <span class="menu">Macro</span>
menu. With these you may quickly copy macros from one document to another, or from and to a text editor for quick modifications.
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="GlobalMacros"></a>Global and User Macros</h3>
<p>
When <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> is launched, it searches some predefined directory paths for macro files, i.e. for
files with the extention <i>.dwam</i>. From any found macro file it reads the contained macro's name and adds it to the
<span class="menu">Run Macro</span> submenu of the <span class="menu">Macro</span> menu. Note that a macro name may be different
from the name of the file that contains the macro. When any of the <span class="menu">Run Macro</span> submenu's items is selected,
then the corresponding macro is executed on the active window's dataset. When assembling the macro list
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> searches these paths:<br>
<li>The <i>macro</i> folder directly in the <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> installation directory. This is <i>/opt/datawarrior/macro</i>,
<i>/Applications/DataWarrior.app/macro</i>, or <i>C:\Program Files\DataWarrior\macro</i> for Linux, Macintosh or Windows (64-bit),
respectively. Macro files in these directories are visible to all users on that computer.</li>
<li>A <i>macro</i> folder in a <i>datawarrior</i> folder in the user's home folder. This is <i>/home/&lt;username&gt;/datawarrior/macro</i> and
<i>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/datawarrior/macro</i> for Linux and Macintosh, respectively. On Windows the home folder location depends on
the version of Windows, the version of Java and other settings. Often it is the user's <i>Desktop</i> folder.
Therefore, <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> supports an additional path on Windows:
<i>C:\\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\DataWarrior\Macro</i>. Any macro files in these directories
are visible to one user only.</li>
<li>Another option is to define one or more custom macro folders by setting the Java system property <i>macropath</i> when launching
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> as e.g.: <i>-Dmacropath=/home/thomas/datawarrior/macros:/home/thomas/datawarrior/test/macros</i>
(on Windows use ';' instead of ':' as separator). On Linux this can be done by updating the launch script <i>/opt/datawarrior/datawarrior</i>.
On OSX one needs to change <i>Info.plist</i> in the DataWarrior.app folder. On Windows this is again less straight forward:
One needs to pass the -D option to the executable when that is launched. One option is to create a shortcut and add the option to it.
However, this approach only works, if DataWarrior is launched from the shortcut. If you know what you are doing, you may also
edit the registry's shell/open/commands for the file extentions "dwar", "dwam", "sdf".</li>
</p>
<br>

<h3><a name="CommandLine"></a>Running Macros from the Command Line</h3>
<p>
One way of using macros is to launch <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> from the command line or from within a shell
script and passing a macro file name as the only parameter. This causes <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> to execute
the macro. If the macro's last task is <span class="menu">Exit Program</span>, then <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span>
would close after the work is done letting the shell script continue with whatever is supposed to follow.<br>
If configured from the macro editor, the <span class="menu">Exit Program</span> task allows to select, how open files with
unsaved content shall be treated when the program closes. The options are not to save anything, to ask, which windows to save,
or to save all Windows with unsaved changes automatically without asking interactive questions.
In the latter case <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> handles Windows differently depending on whether they already
have an existing file association. If a Window was earlier opened by reading a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> file
or if the Window's content was saved earlier into a <span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> file, then changes would be
written into that file effectively overwriting the previous content. If, however, there is no file association, because the
Window's data was retrieved from a database or e.g. created as a combinatorial library, then
<span class="keyword">DataWarrior</span> would save a new file under a unique name in the user's home directory making sure
that no existing file is overwritten.
