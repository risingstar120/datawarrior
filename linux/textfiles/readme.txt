DataWarrior is developed in Java. Therefore, the installation for Linux, Windows, and Macintosh
includes an up-to-date Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Liberica 21 from BellSoft.

To install DataWarrior together with the JRE run the install.sh shell script with root rights.
To install DataWarrior from a terminal window you may type:

> cd datawarrior
> chmod 755 install.sh
> sudo ./install.sh

This installs the datawarrior application and sample data files in /opt/datawarrior/
and registers all datawarrior file types and icons using the XDG freedesktop utilities,
which are installed on major Linux distros.

If you need to uninstall datawarrior later, use the uninstall.sh script in this
directory or its copy in /opt/datawarrior.

Thank you for installing and using DataWarrior.
